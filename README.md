Frontend Service Discovery on AWS is a solution to handle frontend releases on AWS using the [frontend discovery pattern](https://github.com/awslabs/frontend-discovery).

The frontend discovery pattern improves the development experience when developing, testing, and delivering micro-frontends by making use of a shareable configuration describing the entry point of micro-frontends, as well as additional metadata that is used to deploy in every environment safely using Canary Releases.

## Installation

The solution is available as an AWS CloudFormation template and should take
about 10 minutes to deploy. See the
[deployment guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md#deploying-the-solution) for one-click
deployment instructions, and the [cost overview guide](docs/COST_OVERVIEW.md) to
learn about costs.

## Usage

The solution provides a REST Admin API to allow you to integrate it in your own CI/CD pipelines, a well as a REST Consumer API to allow you to integrate the solution with your front-end applications.

See the [user guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md) to learn how to use the solution and
the [API specification](docs/API.md) to integrate the solution with your
own applications. See the [examples](examples) to see some examples on how to integrate the Consumer API with your front-end application.
